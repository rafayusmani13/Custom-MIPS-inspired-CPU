# Custom-MIPS-inspired-CPU
•	Created a MIPS-inspired Assembly subset, featuring special instructions such as register width calculation and program halting.
•	Programmed an IDE for aforementioned Assembly in Python, which reads and compiles machine code input and returns various information, such as register and data memory contents.
•	Designed a custom CPU, including a custom Instruction Memory, Data Memory, and instruction execution.
